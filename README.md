## Hey! <img src="https://github.com/thanusiv/thanusiv/blob/master/assets/gifs/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is Thanushon Sivakaran and I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering graduate student at the University of Waterloo. I also completed my undergrad in Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I have two years of work experience from 6 internships completed during my undergrad where my last three internships were at Apple. I'm from Canada and love learning about different technologies. I am currently learning about Machine Learning and A.I as you can see from my most recent repositories but I have done Mobile (Android) and Web (Angular, ReactJS) development as well!

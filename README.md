## Hey! <img src="https://github.com/thanusiv/thanusiv/blob/master/assets/gifs/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is Thanushon Sivakaran and I am currently studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo where I am specializing in Artificial Intelligence. I have graduated with my Bachelors in Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo with Graduation Dean's Honours and have joined the Dean's Honours List several times during my undergraduate studies. 

I have been fortunate enough to receive several scholarships including the Engineering Excellence Fellowship ($50,000), Vector Scholarship in Artificial Intelligence ($17,500) and the Engineering Dean's Entrance Award ($5,000).

I have completed various co-ops/internships, and my last three internships were at Apple, where I worked on parts of Siri! This includes the complete rewrite of a Python API that queries ASR data, implementing a novel feature for Siri's end-to-end testing pipeline and reducing model training time for Siri's language models. 

I love to learn and work on different technologies and enjoy doing so in any industry. I am very interested in software engineering, machine learning, and natural language processing but I do enjoy trying new things! 

Feel free to reach out, and let's talk!

## Hey! <img src="https://github.com/thanusiv/thanusiv/blob/master/assets/gifs/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is Thanushon Sivakaran and I am a Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo who has completed 3 co-ops/internships so far. I'm from Canada ❤️ and love learning about different technologies. 🌱 I am currently learning about Machine Learning and AI as you can see from my most recent repositories but I have done Mobile (Android) and Web (Angular, ReactJS) development as well! 🌱

💬 Ask me about anything from some of the projects that I worked on, my experience with co-ops and internships or where I think technology is heading!

📫 You can reach me at

## Hey! <img src="https://github.com/thanusiv/thanusiv/blob/master/assets/gifs/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is Thanushon Sivakaran. Iâ€™m a graduate student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo with a background in Mechatronics Engineering. My passion for AI and Machine Learning has driven me to work on impactful projects across various teams, including Siri and Language Technologies at Apple and the Platform Team at Signal 1. I've had the opportunity to optimize data processing pipelines, refactor complex codebases, and enhance machine learning workflows, leading to significant performance improvements. My work spans the development of Python libraries, microservices, and APIs, all while maintaining a focus on efficiency and scalability.

With hands-on experience in deploying technologies like Apache Airflow, Kubernetes, and Azure services, Iâ€™m skilled in building robust systems that support large-scale data operations. My academic journey has been supported by prestigious scholarships, including the Engineering Excellence Fellowship and the Vector Scholarship in Artificial Intelligence. Iâ€™m passionate about using my technical expertise to solve challenging problems and drive innovation in AI/ML.
